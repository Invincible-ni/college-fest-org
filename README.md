# college-fest-organiser.
##The word 'fest'sounds really intresting especially when we involve in managing the event.
**Imagine the whole organisation(either it can be a college/university/any working arena where we find people/students tired of grabbing the knowledge and want to relish,diving into amusement.
This can be done by organising an EVENT/FEST for the college where all the students of the organisation/college generally involve in several tasks,giving some space,relieving from academics(where the tasks can be academic/non-academic).
Organising the event is sometimes a **Nail-biting task,managing the registrations,requirements,necessities,etc...with the only aim to make the college-event successful and to give 100% throughput.
This can be done by building and maintaining a #college-fest-organiser that reduces most of the burden to be handled by the fest/event manager.The only thing to do is to sit and maintain the criteria,functionality of the event on finger-tips.
